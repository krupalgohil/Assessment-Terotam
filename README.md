# Global Terrorism Data Analysis – Internship Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the **Data Analytics Internship Assessment** provided by **Terotem**.  
The project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing global terrorism data to extract meaningful insights related to trends, regions, attack types, and human impact.

---

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this assessment is to:
- Analyze historical global terrorism data
- Identify trends over time
- Understand region-wise and country-wise impact
- Study attack types, weapon usage, and human loss (kills and injuries)
- Present insights using clear visualizations and structured reporting

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
- **Records:** ~180,000 terrorist incidents
- **Time Period:** 1970 onwards
- **Original Columns:** 130+ attributes

Only relevant columns related to **time, location, attack characteristics, and impact (kills & injuries)** were selected to keep the analysis focused and meaningful.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

- Standardized column names for readability
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values:
  - Kills and injuries replaced with `0`
  - Categorical missing values replaced with `"Unknown"`
- Fixed invalid date values
- Created a clean dataset for analysis

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA covers:

- Terrorist attacks trend over the years
- Top affected countries and regions
- Distribution of attack types
- Weapon types used in attacks
- Comparison of kills vs injuries
- Region-wise and year-wise analysis
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables
- Analysis of deadliest countries and terrorist groups

Each visualization is followed by **key findings** to explain insights in simple language.

---

## 🖼 Visualizations

All plots generated during analysis are saved in the `visuals/` folder for easy reference and reporting.

Examples:
- Attacks over years
- Attack type distribution
- Weapon type distribution
- Kills vs injuries
- Region-wise attacks
- Correlation heatmap

## 📄 Report

A detailed **LaTeX report** is included, which contains:
- Introduction and dataset overview
- Data cleaning methodology
- Overall key insights
- Step-by-step EDA with visuals and findings
- Final conclusion

The report is structured professionally and is ready for PDF submission.
